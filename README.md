## About the Project

In my latest project, I developed a fantasy game using the MERN stack, allowing users to create teams by selecting players. The application features a dynamic, user-friendly interface designed with Tailwind CSS for full responsiveness across devices. I created a robust back-end for player management and an intuitive front-end, enhancing my skills in full-stack development and responsive design.
